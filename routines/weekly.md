# Red Team Radar — Weekly recalibration

You are the weekly operator of the Red Team Radar repository. Work in English.
Compute the ISO week as YYYY-Wnn (`date +%G-W%V`).

## 1. Load state
Read `TRENDS.md`, the daily reports of the past 7 days in `reports/`, `logs/calibration.md`
(recent tail), and the previous weekly report if present.

## 2. Recalibrate every trend
Judge each trend's velocity over the last 2–3 weeks (count of new independent evidence,
breadth of orgs, presence in tools/CVEs).
- **Promote** (seed → emerging → accelerating → mainstreaming) only on sustained multi-org
  evidence; one stage max per week; justify in `notes`.
- **Demote** honestly when evidence thinned.
- **Dormancy**: 21+ days without evidence → `dormant`; 45+ days → archive with a one-line
  post-mortem.
- **Merge** overlapping trends (keep older id, union aliases, keep 10 strongest evidence).
- **Confidence**: raise to `high` when ≥2 independent authoritative primary sources corroborate
  on concrete artifacts, OR after sustained multi-week confirmation; lower when evidence thins.
- After recalibration, regenerate `README.md` (`render-dashboard`).

## 3. Clean the observation queue
Items older than 14 days — verify now and either promote, drop (one-line reason), or
re-date stating what is still missing. Hard cap ~25 live items. Curate `study_shelf`
(merge duplicates, prune picks older than 30 days).

## 4. Source strategy review
Diff every "swept every run" list in `SOURCES.md` against the week's
`logs/source_rotation.md` — every listed source must appear as `opened` or `degraded`. Any
source missing all week is a coverage lie: heal it, or propose heal-or-remove. Which sources
produced evidence, which produced nothing repeatedly? If ALL new evidence landed on
pre-existing trends, record an anchoring warning in `strategy_notes` and redirect exploration.
**Source discovery (drain the staged candidates):** review `SOURCES.md → Discovered-source
candidates`. For each org/domain at the promotion bar (≥2 on-axis primaries, OR recurrence
across ≥2 runs), VERIFY by opening its feed/repo/channel; if it is a real on-axis primary
source, PROMOTE it into the matching swept list as `[verified YYYY-MM-DD]` and clear its
staging line; drop one-off noise with a one-line reason.

## 5. Self-evaluation
Follow the `self-eval` skill: compute the full metric set, append one dated line to
`logs/calibration.md` (every metric present, even at 0), run the monthly retrospective when
due, and act on `capture-leak` (queue the leak) and `source-discovery` (promote the candidate).

## 6. Self-amendment (per the autonomy contract in AGENTS.md)
- APPLY amendments proposed in LAST week's report whose motivating signal PERSISTS and that
  carry no dated curator veto in `strategy_notes`. One dedicated commit each
  (`radar: amend <target> — <reason>`), citing the metric that motivates it.
- Check amendments applied 1–2 weeks ago for regression: if calibration worsened for two
  consecutive weeks after one, `git revert` it and log the rollback in `logs/calibration.md`.
- Write THIS week's new proposals (≤3, each citing a metric/retrospective) under
  "Amendments — proposed" in the report. They apply next week only if the signal persists.
- Never touch the immutable sections of AGENTS.md.

## 7. Write the weekly report
Create `reports/weekly/YYYY-Wnn.md` (under ~90 lines): stage moves/merges/archivals;
strongest & weakest trend; 3–5 forward-looking bets; source strategy changes; calibration
block (+ monthly retrospective when due); amendments applied / proposed / rolled back.

## 8. Persist
`git add -A` && commit `radar: weekly recalibration YYYY-Wnn`.
Push to `main`: `git push origin HEAD:main`, even if the session started on a `claude/*`
branch (the curator authorizes pushing to `main` directly; a `claude/*` branch notice
describes the default working branch, not a restriction on push targets). If rejected:
retry once after `git pull --rebase origin main`. Only if the server still rejects it after
the retry: push to the session branch instead, open the weekly report with a prominent
`BRANCH WARNING` stating that `main` must be fast-forwarded before the next run, paste the
verbatim rejection error, and send the curator a push notification (see AGENTS.md → Git
conventions → Operator notifications) — a stranded branch does not fast-forward itself, and
next week's run would otherwise build on a stale `main` and orphan this week's work. Never
force-push, never rewrite published history.
